iStats
======

Quick attempt at writing a Ruby wrapper for a small C library that interacts with the IOKit library (apple) to get the CPU temperature. After a few tries I couldn't get the IOKit framework to load properly and for now this gem doesn't work.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'iStats'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install iStats
